				<h2><b>C++</b></h2>
				
				
					The great majority of my experience with C++ comes from working on university assignments. I have worked with creating game applications following the principles of object-oriented programming using simple frameworks based on C++. Using SFML has taught me how to work with vast external libraries and use their potential to create independent applications. I am well familiar with the syntax and find myself fully comfortable in working with the language.</p>

				<h2><b>C#</b></h2>
				
				
					My experience in working with C# comes mainly from the Unity engine. I have used it to develop 2D, 3D and VR games. The things that i have made in the language include a complete dialogue system, responsive enemy AI that can provide a significant challange to the player and a large number of UI and core elements such as save and achievement systems.

				<h2><b>Unity</b></h2>
				
				
					I have experience in developing a good variety of games in Unity, ranging from 2D platformers, to VR experiences. I have started to work with the engine before going to the university, and it was my first introduction into game development. Since i have used many extensions to fully utilise the power of the engine, and have worked with level design, UI systems, NPC AI, and more.

				<h2><b>Unreal Engine 4/5</b></h2>
				
					I have experience working in Unreal Engine, both solo, and in a team. I have done university work with it that involved reworking an existing application to expand its features. More importantly, i have developed a game in Unreal Engine 5 during the Global Game Jam 2023. I was one of the two programmers involved in the project, and handled player movement with the use of combined C++ and Blueprint.

				<h2><b>HTML/CSS</b></h2>
				
				
				I have experience in designing simple websites with the use of HTML and CSS, with the invaluable help of Bootstrap. This very website serves as an example of my abilities, besides the use of a Bootstrap theme, I have designed it and all the sections entirely by myself. I don’t consider myself to be a great designer, but I have tried my absolute best to ensure all sections are clear and easy to access.

				<h2><b>PHP</b></h2>
				
				
				My knowledge in PHP comes mainly from university work, as well as time spent designing websites in my personal time. The original concept of my portfolio website was dynamically genearted using the template provided by the university. From the university i have learned how to create a login system, as well as how to manage user accounts with a simple data base. From my pesonal experience i have learned how to utilise PHP with the addition of SQL. That being said, my knowledge in SQL is far from sufficient enough to be listed as a separate skill.

				<h2><b>Python</b></h2>
				
				
				Python was the first programming language that I’ve learned, quite a common case in recent years. Initially I was using it for developing simple text games, but more recently I returned to it and started working on a project with Discord API. I have developed a bot for the Discord platform. I am confident in using this language, mainly through developing simple object-oriented applications that handle data from Json files.
