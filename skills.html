While it’s hard to determine what would constitute as a ‘10’ in knowledge, I know I most likely have not reached that point in any subject. I am still learning, and the purpose of this page isn’t to brag about my skills, but to demonstrate what I consider to be my strenghts, and how they compare to areas I’m less confident in. </h4>

	<h4>7/10</h4>
	The great majority of my experience with C++ comes from working on university assignments. I have worked with creating game applications following the principles of object-oriented programming using simple frameworks based on C++. Using SFML has taught me how to work with vast external libraries and use their potential to create independent applications. I am well familiar with the syntax and find myself fully comfortable in working with the language.<p>

	<h4>8/10</h4>
	I have gained plenty of experience in C# while working on various game projects in Unity Engine. Games that are currently hosted on this website were all made using C#, and their source code is available for review. Being one of my first languages, C# has helped me understand cardinal concepts of programming and still remains the language that I’m most comfortable working with.<p>

	<h4>6.5/10</h4>
	I have experience in designing simple websites with the use of HTML and CSS, with the invaluable help of Bootstrap. This very website serves as an example of my abilities, besides the use of a Bootstrap theme, I have designed it and all the sections entirely by myself. I don’t consider myself to be a great designer, but I have tried my absolute best to ensure all sections are clear and easy to access.<p>

		I have gained experience working with PHP both at the University as well as when making this website. Despite it being hidden on the back-end, some content on this website is dynamically generated. To be truthful, I have to admit that building a dynamically generated, object oriented website from scratch is still beyond my skill level. The very core of this site has been built by Dr Tom Hughes-Roberts for the purpose of the tutorials in “Introduction to Web Development” module. I have received a permission from the course leader to use it for personal, non-profit reasons. While the base has been built by someone else, I have learned how to build upon it. I am able to adapt to the environment and working on changing and maintaining websites using PHP.<p>

		<h4>7/10</h4>
		Python was the first programming language that I’ve learned, quite a common case in recent years. Initially I was using it for developing simple text games, but more recently I returned to it and started working on a project with Discord API. I have developed a bot for the Discord platform, you can find more information about it here. I am confident in using this language, mainly through developing simple object-oriented applications that handle data from Json files.<p>

		<h4>8/10</h4>
		Visual studio is by far the IDE I’m most familiar with, and I use it for any project that I can. I have used it to develop standalone C++ applications, as well as C# based Unity games. I know how to use the software well, utilize its functions for file management, debugging and efficient development.<p></p></div>

	I have gained experience in working with UE4 mainly through a recent coursework. With it , I have learned how to modify game objects, work with Blueprint and use the basic functions of the engine.<p></p></div>
